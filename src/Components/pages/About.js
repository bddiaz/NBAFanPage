      <p> This website was made using the React Framework. Additionally, data about the latest
          games and the top players utilize the balldontlie api, which has statistics of all games starting
          in 1970, and current game's stats. The top players were chosen based off a system I decided on based on the points scored by
          every player in each day's game.
